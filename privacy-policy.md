Reveried is a company created by Xavier Tobin. Reveried is the owner of Bundled Notes.

Your privacy and data are important. Because Bundled Notes is a note-taking and organisation service with instant cross device syncing and online storage, Reveried takes a privacy-first, common-sense approach to the information you create and store through use of the service. 

##What information does Bundled Notes collect?
The notes, tags, bundles and reminders you create using Bundled Notes are your “Content”. This Content is encrypted-at-rest by default, as described in the Google Firestore Support Docs. Besides the syncing and backing up of your Content, the following information is collected throughout the use of the service:

###Login Information
When you log in to Bundled Notes, you use a client such as Gmail, Microsoft or Email and Password for authentication. Your authentication information is managed through Firebase to allow you to return to your Content and log in to access your Content on other devices where Bundled Notes is available.

###Basic Analytics/Log Data
Anonymous analytics and “Log Data” collected in Bundled Notes are deliberately bare minimum and collected automatically through Firebase Analytics (and in the case of Android applications, the Google Play Store, as with all apps installed via the Google Play Store). Only basic usage data is collected, none of which is personally identifiable. Examples of the data include: time of access, the number of active users, the country of use, the device and OS version used.

No additional analytics or behaviour tracking is enabled in the service beyond the default implementation of Firebase services. Furthermore, Advertising ID collection through Firebase Analytics is disabled in the Android application.

Detailed crash reports can be sent through the Play Store if a user chooses to send them.

###Subscription Information
If you subscribe to a paid subscription to enable Pro features of Bundled Notes, your subscription status and history to Bundled Notes is tracked to offer and enable the correct features.

##How is this information used?

###Your Content
Your Content is for you, and Bundled Notes/Reveried believes that only you should see it. Your Content will not be read or accessed by Reveried developer/s or any third party, except when absolutely required by law, or through a valid in-app support request specifically engaged by you.

In the case that a request is made to access data by a legal authority, Reveried will strive to ensure it is in compliance with a subpoena, warrant or lawful legal request. In this instance, you will be notified if it is believed that a legal request must be complied with, unless the specific request and relevant law stipulates that user notification is unallowed.

###Basic Analytics
The default analytics collected through Firebase and the Google Play Store are for rudimentary monitoring of the success of the service, such as uninstall rates, retention, update rollout status, number of daily users etc.

This information is strictly used to improve and monitor the success of Bundled Notes and new updates when they are released. Analytics data from Firebase and the Play Store is not shared with or sold to third parties.

###Login Information
Your login details, such as your email address, are used only for the purposes of authentication and account management. Firebase Authentication uses IP addresses and user-agent strings for the purposes of added security and to prevent service abuse during login, though this data is not tracked or visible to Reveried or Bundled Notes developer/s. Your email may be contacted if you have specifically agreed to communication in the case that you send an in-app support query, or if you sign up to opt-in emails about Bundled Notes and feature updates.

For more information on login details, refer to the “Data Processing” portion of the Firebase Privacy and Security Policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy.

###Subscription Information
Subscription information is used to offer the correct features to the user if they upgrade to a paid tier of Bundled Notes. In the rare case that the subscription system detects fraud, Reveried may look at relevant subscription and login information and cancel the subscription if fraud is detected. Any checking for fraud will still apply the same roles as outlined in "Your Content" section - that is to say your notes, bundles, tags and reminders will not be accessed.

##How long is your information stored?
Given the importance of your Content, and the fact that you might want to return to your Content even if you do not use Bundled Notes for some time, your Content is stored until you choose to delete it or permanently terminate your account. No matter how long your Content is stored, the same rules in the “How is this information used?” section applies.
